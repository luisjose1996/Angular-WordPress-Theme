Wordpress Angular Theme
=======================

I know this is crazy
---------------------

###But I just met you.

Install Instructions
=====================
+ Download / Pull All Files
+ FTP to your themes directory
+ Activate Plugin under Appearances
+ Come back and fork me

Why?
----
I wanted to learn Angular, and I already have spent the last 10 years developing in Wordpress. The best way to for me to learn was to make this.. but maybe someone else will find some awesome use for it.

What is it now?
---------------
Now its just a front page that has the ability to create / edit / publish posts to your WP, check your WP admin dashboard to see newly created or edited posts.
